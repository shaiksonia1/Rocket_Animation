# Rocket_Animation

In this mini project, I have created a small animation of a rocket rotating around the moon using HTML and CSS. Using HTML to structure the content of the webpage and CSS to style and animate the rocket.

First, we will set up the basic structure of the webpage using HTML tags such as <html>, <head>, and <body>. We will then create a container element for the rocket using a div tag and style it using CSS.

Next, we will create the rocket itself using a combination of HTML elements and CSS. We will use CSS properties such as height, width, background-color, and border-radius to give the rocket its shape and appearance.
  
Once the rocket is set up, we will use CSS animation techniques to make it rotate around the moon. We will use the animation property and keyframes to define the different stages of the animation and control the timing of the movement.

Finally, we will add some finishing touches to the webpage, such as a background to provide context for the animation.

Overall, this project will provide a fun and engaging way to learn about using HTML and CSS for web development and animation.
